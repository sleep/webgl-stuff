## Why I'm taking this course

- To catalyze a few projects of mine that require 3D computer graphics.
- To be equipped to realize any future project with 3D graphics.
- To extend my frontier of dreamable dreams

*Some musings about the third point:*

At the end of the day, I identify as a maker. As a maker, I like to concern myself with the journey between idea and execution, or in other terms, the journey between dreams and reality.

Suppose dreams all have some basis in reality. After making my first dreams come to reality, I'll be able to dream a larger set of dreams, including some of which were previously undreamable.

I'll realize those second-order dreams, and dream up the third-order dreams, etc...


## What I hope to get out of this course

- The ability to know where to start in implementing any project with 3D graphics.
- Some exploration with user interaction in 3D
- Learn how to wield the GPU for parallel computation.
- Fluency with webgl.

## Topics I'd like to discuss

- stochastic methods for procedural generation
- User interaction in 3D
- Agent-based simulation with the GPU
